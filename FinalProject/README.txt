All outputs are provided in the three directories:
consistent_astar_10min_evaluation
inconsistent_astar_10min_evaluation
inconsistent_astar_10min_evaluation


Parameters for visualisation:
these are located at top of file, toggle to visualise plan only
or visualise exploration, or both.

NOTE short plans will not be seen as they will be printed too fast
so wait until longer ones a reached or add a time delay
into the print_ascii function.

These outputs were generated by modifying paramters during run:



===========================================
consistent_astar_10min_evaluation:

+self.depth
is added to each heuristic

optimal = False (only interested in first plan for speed)
as_bfs= False (not bfs using astar)


============================================

inconsistent_astar_10min_evaluation:

+self.depth
is removed for each heuristic

optimal = False (only interested in first plan for speed)
as_bfs= False (not bfs using astar)

===========================================
PDB_bfs_opt-exhaust_10min-timout_evaluation

as_bfs = True
optimal = True (construct full pdb exhaust all states)
